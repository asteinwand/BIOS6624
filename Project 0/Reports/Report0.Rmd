# Add ggplot 

Booklet-reported sampling times showed extremely strong agreement with cap-recorded times ($\beta_1$ = 0.998, SE = 0.0066, p < 0.0001). The slope was nearly 1, indicating that booklet times tracked cap times almost perfectly across the day. A small but statistically significant bias was observed (intercept = –6.29, p = 0.018), suggesting that participants tended to record booklet times approximately 6 minutes earlier than the cap time. Random intercept variance indicated modest between-subject differences in reporting behavior (SD = 4.29 minutes).
