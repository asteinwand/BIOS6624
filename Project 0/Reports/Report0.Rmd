## Introduction


This project is using data from a study that evaluated the feasibility and accuracy of a novel saliva collection device, the Saliva Procurement and Integrated Testing (SPIT) booklet, used for measuring patterns of cortisol and DHEA. Thirty-one healthy adults collected saliva samples four times per day, at waking, 30 minutes after waking, before lunch, and 600 minutes after waking, for three consecutive days. For each sample taken, two separate time measurements were available, when participants followed protocol correctly. The participant recorded a booklet time manually, and there was an electronic recorded cap time. Hormone concentrations (nmol/L) were assayed with some values missing due to laboratory issues or insufficient sample volumes. Additional missingness occurred if time measurements were not recorded due to device malfunction or participant error. 

The aims of this project focus on three questions: the agreement between booklet recorded time and cap recorded times, the extent to which participants adhered to the protocol sampling windows at 30 minutes after waking and 600 minutes after waking, and the change in cortisol and DHEA levels throughout the day. These three aims were used to create the following hypotheses: 

Aim 1:
$H_0:$ There is no linear association between booklet recorded and cap recorded time.
$H_1:$ There is a linear association between booklet recorded and cap recorded times.

Aim 2:
$H_0:$ The percent of samples collected within 7.5 minutes and within 15 minutes of the scheduled time, is equal to the percent of samples expected outside of the adherence windows.
$H_1:$ The percent of samples that fall within the adherence windows of 7.5 minutes and within 15 minutes, is greater that the percent of samples expected outside the windows indicating good adherence from participants.

Aim 3:
$H_0:$ Cortisol and DHEA levels do not change from waking to 30 minutes after waking, and their rates of change throughout the rest of the day are zero.
$H_1:$ Cortisol and DHEA levels increase from waking to 30 minutes after waking, followed by a non-zero decline throughout the rest of the day.



## Methods

Bullet points:
- figured out which variables had NA values and removed those
- looked at nmol/L cort and DHEA and removed ones >= 80 and 5.205 respectively
- used the new clean data set to move forward with the analysis
- created histograms and box plots to search for outliers or skewness in the data

- research question 1 needed to fill in sleep wake time because only 1 time recorded for each subject for each day 
- ensured every hour/minute times were formatted correctly for calculations
- calculated minutes since waking for both the recorded booklet time and the cap time, by comparing the recorded wake time to booklet and cap time
- fit the LMM with outcome being booklet time since waking with input of cap time minutes since waking, and a random intercept for subject

- research question 2 created variable for scheduled time, for collection sample 2 scheduled time = 30, and for collection sample 4 scheduled time = 600
- compared booklet time to scheduled time to determine deviation, amounts and classified different levels as good = +-7.5 adequate= +-15min and poor as anything outside these ranges
- calculated the percent of samples within the good and adequate and poor categories
- calculated percentage of which subjects had 100% good and 100% adequate adherence
- looked at adherence based on each scheduled time of the 30min and 600min samples

- research question 3 created a time since waking variable in order to split the times into before 30min and after 30min for a piece wise model and used booklet times due to missingness of cap times
- fit a linear mixed model for both cortisol and DHEA of 0 to 30min and after 30min to determine if the slopes are significant







The investigator requested that the analysis quantify missing data rates and exclude biologically implausible hormone values (cortisol >80 nmol/L; DHEA at the assay’s upper detection limit of 5.205 nmol/L).

# Add ggplot 

Booklet-reported sampling times showed extremely strong agreement with cap-recorded times ($\beta_1$ = 0.998, SE = 0.0066, p < 0.0001). The slope was nearly 1, indicating that booklet times tracked cap times almost perfectly across the day. A small but statistically significant bias was observed (intercept = –6.29, p = 0.018), suggesting that participants tended to record booklet times approximately 6 minutes earlier than the cap time. Random intercept variance indicated modest between-subject differences in reporting behavior (SD = 4.29 minutes).
