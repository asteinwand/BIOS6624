Background: 

Cortisol and DHEA are two hormones that regulate our stress system. Cortisol is known to have a peak shortly after waking and then falls over
the day to a low in the evening. Features of this diurnal pattern have been implicated in depression, sleep disorders and many other
conditions. Being able to collect samples to measure this curve in a natural environment (e.g. at home) is useful for research on this
endocrine system. The accuracy of saliva sample collection is crucial to obtaining reliable characterization of the cortisol awakening response
and perhaps defining the diurnal decline in salivary cortisol. 


Investigator's Research Question: 

We tested the use of a convenient and novel collection device for collecting saliva on strips of filter paper in a specially constructed
booklet for determination of both salivary cortisol and DHEA.  In the present study, 31 healthy control subjects collected saliva samples
four times a day for three days using the filter paper device (Saliva Procurement and Integrated Testing (SPIT) booklet) which was maintained
during the collection period in a large plastic bottle with an electronic monitoring cap. Subjects were asked to collect saliva samples at
waking, 30 min later, before lunch and 600 min after waking.  The time of waking and the time before lunch were allowed to vary by the
subjects’ schedules.


Our questions are: 
1) what is the agreement between the subject’s recordings of sampling times compared to the times recorded by an electronic monitoring cap?, 

2) are subjects adhering accurately to the +30min and +10 hour sampling times required by a study protocol?, 

3) what are the changes of cortisol and DHEA over time?


Investigator Questions:
	- How was missingness handled? Time recorded but no value
		○ Some problems at the lab where they couldn't analyze the sample provided
		○ If user forgot to put the cap back on the electronic bottle, might have missing times for samples
	- Time since they reported waking up, not time in between samples interval
	- 999 means missing
	- Cortisol established
		○ Spikes after waking up about 30min, then slowly decreases throughout the day 
		○ Looking at can we catch the spike at 30min and then what is the rate of decline?
		○ Use: Cortisol (nmol/L)
	- Test of association to see if there is any association or bias for 1.
	- For Question 2 time intervals the investigator cares about
		○ For adherence how close are they to the 30min and 10 hour time frame?
		○ Good adherence is within 7.5min plus or minus 
		○ Adequate adherence is within 15min plus or minus
	- Cortisol levels
		○ Over 26, possible but not likely, don't remove
		○ Over 80, laboratory error 
	- DHEA
		○ Upper limit of the assay: 5.205. Super high, likely an error, unless a person was recording it consistently, still exclude because might have something else going on
	- Analyze individual data points within the model not average over the missing ones


Analysis Plans:

	1) Mixed effects model - explain bias and correlation/association
		a. Cap time missing can only calculate for ones you have the pair - different rates of missingness for each group 
	2) Booklet time - Good, adequate, bad adherence
What percent of people make it within the 7.5min window and what percent make it within the 15min window
